# AppRTC - iOS

##About
This Xcode project is a native wrapper prototype in order to communicate with kurentos media server. It works in conjunction with two other projects

There are also:
- a pure websocket AppRTC for Kurento: AppRTC-Kurento and
- a pure websocket AppRTC for Android: AppRTC-Android 

##Todos:


##Todo/Bugs
- (p1) iOS-Websocket does not wake up 
        https://github.com/jmesnil/stomp-websocket/issues/81
        http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3712979/applicationwillenterforeground-vs-applicationdidbecomeactive-applicationwillre
- (p2) (Test) Handsfree speaker test switch with earpiece 
- (p3) third state while changing camera 1-front 2-back -3 off
- (p3) add "audio call" and "video call" button
- (p3) add "answer with audio" and answer "answer with video" button during incoming call  

##Nice2Haves
- play ring-tone when calling
- let websocket go into background mode and handle it as voip socket
    - network service types of nsurlrequest
        https://github.com/facebook/SocketRocket/pull/293
    - example void socket in background

    - https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/iPhone/Conceptual/  iPhoneOSProgrammingGuide/BackgroundExecution/BackgroundExecution.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40007072-CH4-SW1 
    - https://github.com/facebook/SocketRocket/pull/275
    - update socketrocket? https://cocoapods.org/?q=on%3Aios%20socketrocket
- (setup) try multi URL selection list for urls and setups (for development, integration, productionq)

##Improvements & Checks 
- Handsfree speaker test switch with earpiece 
- if url is not reachable or user already registered print error message
- (sept) screen orientation change results in strange behavior - even sometimes connection breaks (Update) orientation change works but is very slow. The Video at the remote side takes at least 10sec to appear again. 
- if phone goes offline does it unregister form server too? 
- don't display own user in listbox because it cannot be called
- Error-Handling:
    - if appConfig is in wrong format display a message
    - wrong-turn-config or server - app crashes here: ARDAppClient.h:416 [_peerConnection addStream:localStream]
    - if server not reachable print message (generally print response messages somewhere in a status field)

##Build WebRTC-Libs
- current https://github.com/Anakros/WebRTC-iOS
- https://github.com/pristineio/webrtc-build-scripts (stopped maintenance! don't use)
- http://ninjanetic.com/how-to-get-started-with-webrtc-and-ios-without-wasting-10-hours-of-your-life/ (doesn't work!)

##Test-WebRTC
- https://webrtc.github.io/samples/src/content/peerconnection/trickle-ice/
- https://test.webrtc.org/
- stun/turn servers: https://gist.github.com/yetithefoot/7592580

##WebRTC-Security 
- Security Considerations http://webrtc-security.github.io/

##Done
- 2016-10-18 - re-enabled camera switch (front-back cam)
- 2016-10-18 - re-enabled mute switch (sound cannot be disabled from phone while broadcasting sound) 
- 2016-10-18 - re-installed stable webrtc pod since pre-release used wrong camera orientation
- 2016-10-12 - iphone switches screen of after some minutes without activity (prevent)
- 2016-10-12 - removed old libjingle implementation and replaced it with new WebRTC.framework pod https://cocoapods.org/pods/WebRTC 
    - generall information on ios
        - http://quickblox.com/developers/Sample-webrtc-ios
    - Try Kurento-iOS 
        - https://media.readthedocs.org/pdf/kurento-ios/latest/kurento-ios.pdf
    - probably stun is not beeing used - instead it uses TURN change WebRTC-Library

        - https://github.com/nubomediaTI/Kurento-iOS
    - framerate and bandwith issues on iOS
        - example to change height-width + framerate https://bugs.chromium.org/p/webrtc/issues/detail?id=4192
        - bitrates @ webrtc-experiment https://www.webrtc-experiment.com/webrtcpedia/
        - bandwidths example http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16712224/how-to-control-bandwidth-in-webrtc-video-call
    - orientation change between potrait an landscape not tested (has probably problems don't try!) 
- 2016-10-11 - iOS is not as fluent as Android 
- 2016-10-11 - rejecting a call from peer does not result in a stop connection on ios.
- 2016-10-04 - call-test-sequence c) Chrome2iPhoneHangupChrome --> d) Chrome2iPhoneHangupiPhone did not work 
                after stopping a call a user sometimes cannot be called again. Signalling is looking for sessions which do not exist anymore. It's not clear why. If the user who hangsup whants to call again he can't the session of the caller cannot be found anymore.
- 2016-10-03   - iOS RemoteVideo freezes in certain situations seems like this bug is related with 
               - iOS freezes only while communicating with a chrome (not with android not with firefox)
               - update kurento
- 2016-09-29    - app goes in stand-by mode after some time during video broadcast
                - app goes in stand-by mode and closes websocket 
                - websocket stays online when app goes in to background - also when no active video connectino 
- "waiting for answer" does not disappear (should be removed) 
- 2016-09-15    - calling the phone - video does not appear instantly (after a shake it comes)
                - calling from the phone - video appears full and after shake the small vindow comes too
                - miniLocalVideoDoesNotAppear / RemoteVideo does not appear   
- 2016-09-12 - fix ios Connection Problem
                Possibilities:
                - enable ipv6 on le-space.de
                    -- Update: ipv6 is enabled(!) - but cannot be pingt from #pipoca nor from #webrtc.a-fk.de -- need network which can ping IPv6  
                - create fast(!) server at amazon with IPv6 
                    -- Update: amazon with IPv6 does not work if I sit inside of a not ipv6 routed NAT.
                - download libjingle from somewhere and try: e.g. 
                    - https://github.com/chamara-dev/gate_libjingle_peerconnection/tree/master/libjingle_peerconnection

                - create webrtc.libs for ios with
                    - https://webrtc.org/native-code/development/ and/or
                    - https://webrtc.org/native-code/ios/
                    - apprtc - client with new webrtc.libs for ios do not connect correctly 
                            (websocket connection problem of ios whitelist? - no info.plist) 
                - ask webrtc mailing list
                - check creator of forked project 
                - follow reactNative issue: https://github.com/oney/react-native-webrtc/issues/79
                - follow with ipv6/reflexiveIP 
                        - https://bugs.chromium.org/p/webrtc/issues/detail?id=5871

                        ##Observations
                - ios client did not connect well in travelercaf√© network (reflexive connectivity test failed: https://test.webrtc.org/)

## Features
* Fully native objective-c 64-bit support
* pre-compiled libWebRTC.a (saves you hours of compiling)
* Starting in v1.0.2 we are now referencing pod libjingle_peerconnection maintained by Pristine.io that has a an automated libWebRTC.a build process
* Utilizes Cocoa Pod dependency management
* View Controllers to easily drop into your own project
* Exposed APIs to easily customize and adapt to your needs (see below for more details)
* Supports the most recent https://apprtc.appspot.com (October 2015)
* We also have a fork of the [Google AppRTC Web Server](https://github.com/ISBX/apprtc-server) that maintains full compatibility with this project
